## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Full-Stack Software Developer with a proven track record in modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks. I have successfully developed dynamic web and mobile applications using React, React Native, and Next.js. My backend expertise includes efficiently managing server-side logic with Koa and Express, as well as optimizing data handling with both relational databases like PostgreSQL and non-relational databases like MongoDB.

As a dedicated problem solver who thrives in fast-paced environments, I am passionate about delivering seamless, user-friendly applications that consistently exceed client and user expectations. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, I always push to excel at creating cohesive full-stack solutions.

I am a collaborative team player with a demonstrated ability to manage code versioning and facilitate team collaboration using Git and GitHub. My commitment to continuous learning and adaptation ensures that I remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.

I find joy in music, playing guitar, video games, and exploring new destinations, delving into diverse cultures and historical contexts. As a lifelong learner with a diverse range of interests, Iâ€™m always eager to expand my horizons both personally and professionally.

Looking for a tech-savvy teammate to tackle the latest trends? Letâ€™s collaborate.
